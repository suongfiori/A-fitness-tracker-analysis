# Fitness Tracker - A Usage Trends Analysis With R

(This is a case study for my Google Data Analytics Capstone "How can a wellness technology company play it smart?")

### Project Scenario
* The goal of this analysis is to provide Bellabeat - a successful small high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women - an insight into how consumers are using a competitor's devices (i.e, Fitbit tracker).
* Insights gained from the analysis would then be used to help inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
### Process
* Exploring the Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset contains personal fitness tracker data consented from thirty fitbit users.
* Looking at users' daily and hourly-level outputs for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring to explore users' habits when using tracker devices.
* Identifying trends and relationships of variables in different levels of activity using the exploratory approach.
* Focus on one of Bellabeat’s products while analyzing Fitbit's data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.
* Providing a summary of the analysis to the Bellabeat executive team with visualizations and key findings.
* Making recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
